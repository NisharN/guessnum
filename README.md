## Overview

"Guess the Random Number" is a simple yet engaging game where users try to guess a random number between 1 and 10. They have three chances to guess correctly. The app uses React’s state and component structure, leveraging both the virtual DOM and the browser DOM to manage and render the UI efficiently. Styling is handled with Tailwind CSS for a responsive, modern interface.

## Features

- Random number generation for each game session
- Responsive UI with animations on hover and focus
- Three chances to guess the number, with feedback on each attempt
- Simple and intuitive design using Tailwind CSS
- DOM handling with virtual and browser DOM

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For component-based structure and state management
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and animations
- **Browser DOM & Virtual DOM**: Efficient DOM manipulation for performance and responsiveness
